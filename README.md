# Optical-heart-rate-monitor
## Inroduction
Our goal was to build an optical heart rate monitor, which is as small as possible. Heart rate is measured from the wrist, and device has to send heart rate data with bluethooth to for example to smart phone. Device is powered by battery which means that it is completely wireless and the device can be worn during exercise.

Final report done by our group can be seen here
