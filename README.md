## Inroduction
Our goal was to build an optical heart rate monitor, which is as small as possible. Heart rate is measured from the wrist, and the device sends the heart rate data with bluethooth to smart phone for example. The device is powered by battery which means that it is completely wireless and the device can be worn during exercise.

Final report in Finnish done by our group can be seen [here](https://github.com/Apemonni/Optical-heart-rate-monitor/blob/master/Loppuraportti.pdf)
